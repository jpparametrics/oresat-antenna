# oresat-antenna
This is a place for RF details of the antennas used on the OreSat CubeSat

On the OreSat structure there are antennas placed on the +Z and -Z surfaces.

*  On the +Z surface is the directional helix antenna for high speed S-Band scientific communications. This is also known as
the _DxWiFi experiment_.

*  On the -Z surface is the tri-band omnidirectional (nearly "isotropic radiator") turnstile antenna used for:
   * UHF telemetry and engineering downlink
   * L-Band engineering uplink
   * A secondary S-Band up/downlink backup antenna
